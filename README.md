# Flight-Cancellation-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight cancellations in the U.S. domestic air traffic system using machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, spanning August 2019 to August 2023, we developed predictive models to classify flight delays effectively.

The SVM model significantly outperformed the KNN model, achieving a high accuracy of 99.77% compared to KNN's 96.44%. SVM demonstrated superior precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for minority class predictions, making it the better choice for this task. This highlights the potential of machine learning in improving flight delay predictions and supporting decision-making.
